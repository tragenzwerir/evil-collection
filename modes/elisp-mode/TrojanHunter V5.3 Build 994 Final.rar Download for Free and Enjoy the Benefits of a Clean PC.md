Trojans are a type of malware that disguise themselves as legitimate programs or files and perform malicious actions on your system. They can steal your personal information, damage your files, monitor your online activity, open backdoors for hackers, install other malware or even take control of your device. Trojans are often distributed through email attachments, fake downloads, infected websites or removable media.
 
TrojanHunter can help you detect and remove trojans that may have escaped the detection of your antivirus software. It has a large and frequently updated database of known trojans and their variants. It can also identify unknown trojans based on their behavior and characteristics. TrojanHunter can scan your system in various modes, such as quick scan, full scan, custom scan or scheduled scan. You can also adjust the scan settings according to your preferences and needs.
 
TrojanHunter is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. It displays the scan results in a clear and detailed manner, showing you the name, location, size and risk level of each detected trojan. You can choose to delete, quarantine or ignore the trojans according to your decision. TrojanHunter also keeps a log of all the actions it performs and allows you to restore any changes it made if necessary.
