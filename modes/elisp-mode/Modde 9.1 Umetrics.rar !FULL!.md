# How to Use MODDEÂ® for Design of Experiments (DOE) - A Beginner's Guide
  
Design of experiments (DOE) is a powerful technique for optimizing processes, reducing costs, and improving quality. DOE helps you design effective experiments, analyze the results, and find the best settings for your process variables. But how do you use DOE software like MODDEÂ® to perform these tasks?
  
In this article, we will show you how to use MODDEÂ® for DOE in a simple and practical way. We will cover the following topics:

## What is MODDEÂ® and why should you use it?
  
MODDEÂ® is a software package developed by Umetrics that specializes in design of experiments (DOE). It is part of the Umetrics Suite of Data Analytics Solutions, which also includes SIMCAÂ® for multivariate data analysis (MVDA) and SIMCA-online for real-time process monitoring and control.
  
MODDEÂ® is designed to help experimentalists get DOE right from the start. It has built-in guidance and quality measures that ensure you make the best experimental choices and get the most relevant and effective outcomes. It also has automated routines and informative data visualizations that speed up your progress and guide you to the best solutions.
  
MODDEÂ® can be used for any industry or application that involves experimentation, such as petrochemicals, pharma, food, fragrance, pulp, paper, plastic, etc. With MODDEÂ®, you can:

## How to set up a DOE project in MODDEÂ®
  
To start using MODDEÂ®, you need to create a new project. A project is a collection of files that contains all the information related to your DOE study, such as factors, responses, designs, models, plots, etc.
  
To create a new project in MODDEÂ®, follow these steps:

1. Open MODDEÂ® and click on File > New Project.
2. Select a template for your project. A template is a predefined set of settings that helps you get started quickly. You can choose from Basic DOE templates or Advanced DOE templates depending on your needs.
3. Enter a name for your project and click OK.
4. A new project window will open with a guided workflow wizard on the left side. The wizard will help you through the steps of setting up your project.

The first step in setting up your project is to define your factors and responses. Factors are the input variables that you can control or manipulate in your experiment, such as temperature, pressure, concentration, etc. Responses are the output variables that you want to measure or optimize in your experiment, such
