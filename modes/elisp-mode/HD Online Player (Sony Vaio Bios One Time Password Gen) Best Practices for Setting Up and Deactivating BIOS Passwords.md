## Contacting Sony Support
 
This is the official and recommended way to reset BIOS password on Sony Vaio laptop. However, it may take some time and cost some money, depending on your warranty status and location. You will also need to provide proof of ownership and some information about your laptop model and serial number. Here are the steps to contact Sony support:
