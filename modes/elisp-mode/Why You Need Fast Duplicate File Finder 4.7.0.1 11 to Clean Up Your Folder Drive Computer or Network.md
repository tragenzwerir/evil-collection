## Step 2: Launch Fast Duplicate File Finder 4.7.0.1 11 and Add Folders to Scan
 
The next step is to launch Fast Duplicate File Finder 4.7.0.1 11 from the Start menu or the desktop shortcut. You will see the main interface of the software, which consists of four tabs: Project Options, Scan Criteria, Scan Results, and Preview.
 
To start scanning for duplicate files, you need to add the folders that you want to scan to the Project Options tab. You can do this by clicking on the Add Folder button and browsing for the folder on your computer. You can also drag and drop folders from Windows Explorer to the software window.
 
You can add as many folders as you want to scan, but keep in mind that scanning more folders will take more time and resources. You can also exclude certain folders or file types from the scan by using the Exclude Folders or Exclude Masks buttons.
 
## Step 3: Set the Scan Criteria and Start the Scan
 
After adding the folders to scan, you need to set the scan criteria on the Scan Criteria tab. This is where you can specify how the software will compare the files and determine if they are duplicates or not.
 
You can choose from four different modes of comparison: 100% Equal Files, Similar File Names, Similar File Content (Fuzzy Match), or Similar Images (Visual Compare). Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on your needs and preferences.
 
For example, if you want to find exact duplicates that have the same content regardless of their name or date, you can use the 100% Equal Files mode. This mode will compare the files byte by byte and ensure that they are identical in every aspect.
 
If you want to find duplicates that have similar names but may have different content or date, you can use the Similar File Names mode. This mode will compare the files based on their name similarity using a percentage threshold that you can adjust.
 
If you want to find duplicates that have similar content but may have different names or date, you can use the Similar File Content (Fuzzy Match) mode. This mode will compare the files based on their content similarity using a percentage threshold that you can adjust.
 
If you want to find duplicates that are images that look alike but may have different names or date, you can use the Similar Images (Visual Compare) mode. This mode will compare the images based on their visual similarity using a percentage threshold that you can adjust.
