Epsxe000.mcr and epsxe001.mcr are memory card files used by ePSXe, a PlayStation emulator for Windows, Linux and Android. ePSXe allows users to play PSX games on their computers or mobile devices with high compatibility and performance.
 
Memory card files store the save data of PSX games, such as progress, settings and characters. ePSXe uses two memory card files by default, one for each slot. The first one is named epsxe000.mcr and the second one epsxe001.mcr. Each file has a size of 128 KB, which is the standard size of a real PSX memory card. The format of the files is simply a dump of real memory cards, so they can be used with other emulators or devices that support PSX memory cards.

ePSXe does not come with a memory card editor, but users can access the real PSX memory card editor by using the option Load -> Run BIOS. From there, they can delete or move savegames between slots or files. ePSXe also supports different memory card file formats, such as Dexdrive (.gme), PSEmu Pro (.mc) and several others. Users can select which file they want to use in which slot by using the memory card file selector in ePSXe's menu.
 
If users want to edit their memory card files more easily, they can use external tools that are available online. For example, NGEmu's ePSXe download area has several tools for managing memory card files[^1^]. Users can also find some memory card files with preloaded savegames for various PSX games on GitHub[^2^] [^3^].

## How to use a different memory card file format in ePSXe
 
ePSXe supports various memory card file formats, such as Dexdrive (.gme), PSEmu Pro (.mc), Connectix Virtual Game Station (.mem) and Bleem! (.mcr). To use a different memory card file format in ePSXe, users need to convert the file to the standard ePSXe format (.mcr) or vice versa. This can be done by using external tools that can read and write different memory card file formats.

## How to use real PSX memory cards with ePSXe
 
Some users may want to use their real PSX memory cards with ePSXe, either to transfer their savegames from their PSX console to ePSXe or vice versa, or to play their PSX games with their original save data. To do this, users need a device that can connect their PSX memory cards to their computer, such as a Dexdrive or a PSX Memory Card Adapter. These devices can read and write data from and to PSX memory cards and create memory card files that can be used with ePSXe.
 
To use real PSX memory cards with ePSXe, users need to follow these steps:

1. Connect the device that can read and write PSX memory cards to the computer. Insert the PSX memory card into the device.
2. Use the software that comes with the device to create a memory card file from the PSX memory card. Save the file with a .gme extension for Dexdrive or a .psx extension for PSX Memory Card Adapter.
3. Use MemcardRex or another tool to convert the memory card file to the standard ePSXe format (.mcr).
4. Open ePSXe and select the converted memory card file for the desired slot.

Note: Users can also use this method to transfer their savegames from ePSXe to their real PSX memory cards. They just need to do the steps in reverse order.
  
## How to share savegames with other ePSXe users
 
Some users may want to share their savegames with other ePSXe users, either to show off their progress, to help others who are stuck in a game, or to play multiplayer games online. To do this, users need to send their memory card files or individual savegames to other users and instruct them on how to use them with ePSXe.
 
To share savegames with other ePSXe users, users need to follow these steps:

1. Open ePSXe and go to Config -> Memory Cards. Note down the name and location of the memory card file that contains the savegame that needs to be shared.
2. Close ePSXe and locate the memory card file on the computer. Copy or compress the file and send it to the other user via email, cloud storage, file sharing service or any other method.
3. Instruct the other user on how to use the memory card file with ePSXe. They need to place the file in their \memcards directory and select it for the desired slot in Config -> Memory Cards.

Note: Users can also share individual savegames instead of whole memory card files. To do this, they need to use MemcardRex or another tool to extract or import single savegames from or to memory card files.
