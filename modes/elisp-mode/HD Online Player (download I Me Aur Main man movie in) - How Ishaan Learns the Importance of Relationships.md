## Reviews
 
I, Me Aur Main received mixed reviews from critics and audiences. The film was praised for its performances, especially by John Abraham and Prachi Desai, but criticized for its weak script, direction and editing.

> "I, Me Aur Main is a refreshing take on relationships in urban India. John Abraham delivers one of his best performances as the flawed but lovable Ishaan. Prachi Desai is a revelation as the spirited Gauri. The film has a breezy pace and a feel-good vibe that will appeal to the young audience."

> "The film is a light-hearted comedy that explores the dynamics of modern relationships. The chemistry between John Abraham and Prachi Desai is delightful and they make a cute pair. The film also has some emotional moments that touch your heart. The music by Falak Shabir, Sachin-Jigar and Gourov Dasgupta is catchy and suits the mood of the film."

Some of the negative reviews are:

> "The film is a dull and boring affair that fails to engage the viewer. The plot is predictable and cliched and the characters are one-dimensional and stereotypical. The film tries to be funny but ends up being silly and annoying. The film wastes the talent of its actors and tests the patience of its audience."

> "The film is a poor imitation of other better films in the genre. The film lacks originality and creativity and relies on outdated tropes and formulas. The film has no depth or substance and offers nothing new or interesting. The film is a disappointment for the fans of John Abraham and Chitrangda Singh."
