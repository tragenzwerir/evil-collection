An EX4 file is a compiled program written in MetaQuotes Language 4 (MQL4), a scripting language for developing trading robots, technical indicators, scripts, and function libraries for MetaTrader 4, a popular online trading platform. An EX4 file contains executable code that has been optimized for faster execution and protected from decompilation.
 
However, some traders and developers may want to access the source code of an EX4 file for educational purposes, modification, or improvement. This process is called decompilation and it involves converting the binary code of the EX4 file back to the human-readable code of the MQ4 file, which is the original source code file of MQL4 programs.

Decompiling an EX4 file is not easy and not always legal. According to MetaTrader developers, decompilation violates the intellectual property rights of the original developers and is prohibited in most countries. Therefore, before attempting to decompile an EX4 file, one should first contact its developer and ask for permission or for the MQ4 file directly.
 
If the developer is not available or does not provide the MQ4 file, then one may resort to using some tools or methods that can decompile an EX4 file to some extent. However, these tools and methods are not reliable, accurate, or ethical. They may produce incomplete, incorrect, or obfuscated code that is hard to read or modify. They may also contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can harm your computer or steal your personal information.
 
Some of the tools and methods that claim to decompile an EX4 file to MQ4 are:
 
- **EX4 to MQ4 converters:** These are software programs that can supposedly convert an EX4 file to an MQ4 file. However, they may not work with newer versions of EX4 files that are more secure and encrypted. They may also produce low-quality code that is not compatible with MetaTrader 4 or other MQL4 programs. Some examples of these converters are EX4-TO-MQ4 Decompiler 2023[^2^], Purebeam Decompiler, and EX4-TO-MQ4 V 224.
- **Binary decompilers:** These are software programs that can analyze and reverse-engineer binary code of any executable file, including EX4 files. However, they require advanced knowledge and skills in cryptography and binary decompilation. They may also produce assembly code that is very difficult to understand or translate to MQL4. Some examples of these decompilers are IDA Pro, NSA Ghidra, and OllyDbg.
- **MQL4 libraries:** These are function libraries that can be imported and used in MQL4 programs. Some of them may contain functions that can read or write EX4 files. However, they may not be able to decompile the entire EX4 file or extract the original source code. They may also be outdated or incompatible with newer versions of MetaTrader 4 or MQL4. Some examples of these libraries are ex4\_reader, ex4\_writer, and ex4\_tools.

In conclusion, decompiling an EX4 file to MQ4 is a challenging and risky task that should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and authorized by the original developer. It may result in poor-quality code, legal issues, or security threats. Therefore, it is recommended to use only trusted and verified sources of MQL4 programs and respect the intellectual property rights of their creators.
